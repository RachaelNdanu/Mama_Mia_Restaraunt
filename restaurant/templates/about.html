          <p>Based in Chicago, Illinois, Little Lemon is a family owned Mediterranean restaurant. We focus on traditional recipes served with a modern twist.</p>
          <p>Our chefs draw inspiration from Italian, Greek, and Turkish culture. We have a menu of 12-15 items that we rotate seasonally.</p>
          <p>The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with moderate prices. This makes it a popular place for a meal any time of the day.</p>
          <p>Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and Adrian. They moved to the United States to pursue their shared dream of owning a restaurant.</p>
          <p>Mario crafts the menu using family recipes and his experience as a chef in Italy.</p>
          <p>Adrian handles all the marketing for the restaurant. He led the effort to expand the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional cuisines from the Mediterranean region.</p>
